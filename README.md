## Quickstart

This project requires [Pinocchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio) and [Assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp) (Pinocchio and HPP-FCL would suffice).

The Rerun viewer needs to be installed for visualizations to work. Follow their [Getting Started](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/tree/main#getting-started) to see how to install it.
